# la meute

as a gift for my five best friends (i am indeed an amazing friend to have around), i decided to make a little website dedicated to usü§ç

‚ö† some of the website's content will be locked behind a connection page (only the six of us have logins)

### the homepage 

built around a feed of posts as the main activity, it will also contain a section about  but also two divs, one being a daily memory we all share with a picture, the other being the current weather in each of the towns we live in

### the chats page 

for each user, six chats will be available: one chat for all of the other users and a group chat

### the profile page

a profile page contains all the posts of the user, his username, pfp and bio
you can either look at your own profile and modify it (only your pfp and your bio, or look at the other user's and dm them from it)

### the game page
