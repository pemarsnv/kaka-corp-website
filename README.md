# kaka-corp-website

as a gift for my five best friends, i decided to start a website dedicated to usü§ç
- the website will be locked behind a connection page, only the six of us can access its content
- four type of pages will be available in the final website:

### the homepage 

the homepage will be built around a feed of posts as the main activity, but also two divs, one being a daily memory we all share with a picture, the other being the current weather in each of the towns we live in

### the chats page 

for each user, six chats will be available: one chat for all of the other users and a group chat

### the profile page

a profile page contains all the posts of the user, his username, pfp and bio
you can either look at your own profile and modify it (only your pfp and your bio, or look at the other user's and dm them from it)

### the game page

each day, a game similar to valdle or loldle will be available, but with the guess of one or our interests!!
the criterias will be the type of interest (anime, game or tv show) and one for each of us indicating if they are interested in it or not
